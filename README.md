## 🧠 Who I Am

I am a **PhD researcher in Computer Science**, an **AI safety engineer**, a **cybersecurity practitioner**, and a **technology entrepreneur** — all at once, unapologetically.

I spend my days solving problems that most people haven't named yet: preventing AI systems from gaming their own reward functions, building defenses against insider threats, and designing educational AI that actually teaches instead of performing teaching.

I build companies when I'm not writing papers. I write papers when I'm not building companies.

> *"Most people either think or build. I refuse to choose."*

## 🔬 Research

I am a **PhD Candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi**, working in the **Cyber Innovation Lab** under Professor Nick Rahimi.

My dissertation centres on **SmartTutor** — an AI tutoring system that solves the reward hacking problem in educational reinforcement learning through architectural constraints combining:

- Reinforcement Learning with constrained policy optimization
- Knowledge Graphs for pedagogical alignment
- Matrix Factorization for learner modelling
- Federated Learning for privacy-preserving personalization

**Results:** 100% pedagogical appropriateness vs. 57–63% for baseline methods. The difference between a system that educates and one that performs education.

### 📄 Selected Publications & Work
- **MC-CPO** — Mastery-Conditioned Constrained Policy Optimization *(Under review, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies)*
- **DANTE.v2** — Insider threat detection system *(Accepted, CATA 2026, Honolulu)*
- **AMDS** — Attack-Aware Multi-Stage Defense System for network intrusion detection — 94.2% AUC
- Peer reviewer, **Springer Nature journals**

## 📍 A Bit More

🇳🇬 Nigerian. Based in the United States.
🎓 PhD Candidate, graduating May 2027.
🔐 I teach web security by breaking things intentionally — in a lab.
🌍 Building technology that works for Africa, not just in spite of it.
